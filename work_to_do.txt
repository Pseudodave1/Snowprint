(1) Extend "operator_utils.py" to pick out (A) consensus and (B) most symmetric operators among homologs
	#Simon is currently working on this
(2) Extend "operator_utils.py" (or create new file) to narrow down intergenic regions to a conserved subset via a multiple sequence alignment.

(3) Extend "acc2operon.py" to find any regulators within a given operon (to go from input:enzyme to output:regulator)

(4) Create functional "chemical2enzyme.py" file to pull out a list of enzymes (ACC IDs) known to interact with an input chemical



(5) Piece together functional 'constructor programs' (ENZYME_TO SENSORS, CHEMICAL_TO_SENSORS, PREDICT_OPERATOR, OPTIMIZE_OPERATOR).

(6) Stress test above functions with a bunch of regulators, enzymes, and chemicals






(7) Test out predictions on the bench!!!







(8) Incorporate tools on Flask web app.
