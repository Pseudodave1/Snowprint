Create a dictionary with:
- Accession
- Protein sequence
- Operator sequence

for every accession in the regulator (TetR for now) database
that isn't an outlier, after clustering. That is, for sequences
that cluster into a group of X size or greater. X = 100? We'll see...

Manually add operators for defined regulators with known
(literature verified) operators.

Create a scripts to:

(1) Score operator predictions based on a consensus motif.
	- Each base gets a certain weight based on conservation.
	- Score can also identify orthogonal operators.

	- consensus motif gets it's own score based on:
		# of sequences used to create it and,
		experimental evidence, from the literature

(2) Add accession-operator pair to dictionary (above) if:
	operator prediction score passes a certain threshold
